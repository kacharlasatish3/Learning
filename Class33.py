# why we need time.sleep , is there any other alternative
# In selenium it will not wait for any element to load , it will continue execution
# Wait concepts => Implicit wait,explicit wait
# Implicit wait  => this we will give at top of the code or page level
# driver.Implicit_wait(10)=> if elements are loaded with in 8 secs it will save other 2 secs
# Explicit wait => we will provide wait on particular element and based on condition

# SDLC => WATERFALL ,AGILE
# AGILE => Ceremonies
# 1) Sprint Planing  => Sprint duration =>we will plan work for 2 weeks
# ,in 2 weeks first day will be Sprint planing =>they will plan the work which we need work /which task we need to work
# they will define sprint goal => what we have to achieve end of the sprint
# Product owner , Scrum master
# Product owner => who will provide the requirement/acceptance criteria
# Scrum master => he will conduct daily scrum meeting, and he will co-ordinate with team members and
# dependencies and will arrange required things to team
# 2) daily scrum => we will have daily 15 mins meeting =>
# what I worked yesterday and what is the status of that , what I am working today
# is there any blockers for you
# 3) Sprint Review meeting => End of the sprint ,last day of the sprint or immediate next day of end of sprint
# we will show case/give demo regarding the work which we have done in last two weeks
# we will get suggestions from client/stack holders , product owners , we can get the requirement changes also
# and work in future sprint
# 4) Sprint Retro => how the last sprint was , this will be conduct next day of end of sprint
# Liked => what is the gud thing happend ,example : if every one completed task in on time
# Learnt => like we learnt about new apis/new functionality or we learnt any new technology
# Lacked => we are not able to achieve goals , we are not able to deliver results , you have some dependencies
# from developer you didnt received build in on time
# action => what to do to solve the issues which we have seen in last sprint

# 5) backlog refinement => it will be conducted by product owner, and he will plan the work future work
# he will explain about stories , what are the dependencies for each story and how much time it will take
# how time it will take from testing => he will create tasks under stories



# JIRA
# GIT hub => version control
# central repository => server where we can place our source code so every one will get access
# Git hub , Bit Bucket ,Azure devops
# Git hub => open source version control
# Control from local by using github for desktop GUI tool
# steps to follow => Clone repository , provide local path
# now if we perform any changes in the file , it will show in change list
